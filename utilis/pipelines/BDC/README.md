# BDC

BDC is a package for the Burkitt and Diffuse large B cell lymphoma classification based on gene expression data. The main advantage is its ability to effectively classify samples from different platforms as well as data generated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. It is an easy to use classifier with only one main function, and users can choose from a list of options for classifier gene set, cross-platform normalization method and dataset to train the model along with reasonable default settings. Also the package provides a simple summary and plot functions for users to interoperate the classification results.
This guide gives an introduction on the main functions of the package.
